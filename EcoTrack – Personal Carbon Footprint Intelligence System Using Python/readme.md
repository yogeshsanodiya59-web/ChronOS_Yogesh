# 🌍 EcoTrack – Personal Carbon Footprint Intelligence System

EcoTrack is a full-stack environmental web application that helps individuals calculate, analyze, and reduce their personal carbon footprint.  

Built using **Python (Flask), HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and Vanilla JavaScript**, the platform provides real-time calculations, graphical analysis, personalized recommendations, and environmental impact insights.

EcoTrack solves this problem by:
- Calculating individual carbon footprint
- Providing monthly & yearly projections
- Offering smart reduction suggestions
- Encouraging sustainable lifestyle changes
- Gamifying eco-friendly behavior

## ✨ Core Features

### 1️⃣ Carbon Footprint Calculator
Users input:
- Travel distance (Car / Bus / Train / Flight)
- Electricity usage (kWh)
- Diet type (Vegan / Vegetarian / Non-Vegetarian)
- Fuel consumption

System calculates:
- Total monthly CO₂ emissions
- Yearly projection

---

### 2️⃣ Real-Time Preview (JavaScript Powered)

- Dynamic updates without page reload

---

### 3️⃣ Graphical Visualization
- Monthly breakdown chart
- Annual projection chart
- Comparison against average emissions

---

### 4️⃣ Carbon Score System
Users receive a score out of 100:
- 🟢 Green (Low Impact)
- 🟡 Moderate
- 🔴 High Impact

---

### 5️⃣ Smart Recommendation Engine
Personalized suggestions based on user data:
- Reduce car travel
- Switch to LED lighting
- Adopt plant-based meals
- Use public transport

---

### 6️⃣ Carbon Offset Estimator
- Shows number of trees required to offset emissions
- Suggests approximate carbon neutrality cost

---

### 7️⃣ Gamification
Badges:
- 🌿 Eco Beginner
- 🌳 Green Warrior
- 🌎 Climate Champion

---

## 🧮 Carbon Calculation Logic

### Travel Emissions (per km)
- Car → 0.21 kg CO₂
- Bus → 0.10 kg CO₂
- Train → 0.05 kg CO₂
- Flight → 0.25 kg CO₂

### Electricity
- 0.82 kg CO₂ per kWh

### Diet (Monthly Estimate)
- Vegan → 50 kg CO₂
- Vegetarian → 100 kg CO₂
- Non-Vegetarian → 200 kg CO₂

## 📊 Future Improvements

- AI-based carbon prediction
- Location-based emission factors
- API integration for real electricity data
- Social sharing & leaderboard
- Mobile app version
- NGO partnership for real tree plantation tracking

---

## 🌱 Real-World Impact

EcoTrack promotes:
- Climate awareness
- Sustainable lifestyle adoption
- Carbon neutrality mindset
- Data-driven environmental responsibility

---

## 📌 Why This Project Stands Out

- Full-stack implementation
- Real-world environmental relevance
- Clean, professional UI
- Data visualization
- Scalable to SaaS
- Hackathon-ready
- Resume-worthy
